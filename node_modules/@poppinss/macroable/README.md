> Extend classes from outside in using Macros and getters

Macroable offers a simple API for adding properties and getters to the class prototype. You might not even need this package, if you are happy writing `Object.defineProperty` calls yourself.

## Usage
Install the package from npm packages registry as follows.

```sh
npm i @poppinss/macroable

# yarn lovers
yarn add @poppinss/macroable
```

And import the `Macroable` class.

```ts
import Macroable from '@poppinss/macroable'
export class Route extends Macroable {}
```

Now, you can add properties to the Route class from outside-in. This is usually needed, when you want the consumer of your classes to be able to extend them by adding custom properties.

## Macros
Getters are added to the class prototype directly.

```ts
Route.macro('head', function (uri, callback) {
  return this.route(['HEAD'], uri, callback)
})
```

And now, you can will be use the `head` method from an instance of the `Route` class.

```ts
const route = new Route()
route.head('/', () => {})
```

Adding a macro is same as writing the following code in JavaScript.

```ts
Route.prototype.head = function () {
}
```

## Instance properties
Since, macros are defined on the prototype of the class and therefore they loose the `this` context when destructured from the class instance. For example:

```ts
HttpContext.macro('getUser', function (this: HttpContext) {
  return this.auth.user
})

const { getUser } = ctx
getUser() // ❌ Error: Cannot read property auth of undefined
```

In order to fix this issue, the properties that can be destructured must be defined as instance properties on the class.

```ts
HttpContext.instanceProperty('getUser', function (this: HttpContext) {
  return this.auth.user
})

const { getUser } = ctx
getUser() // ✅ Works fine
```

## Getters
Getters are added to the class prototype using the `Object.defineProperty`. The implementation of a getter is always a function.

```ts
Route.getter('version', function () {
  return 'v1'
})
```

And now access the version as follows.

```ts
const route = new Route()
route.version // v1
```

Adding a getter is same as writing the following code in JavaScript.

```ts
Object.defineProperty(Route.prototype, 'version', {
  get() {
    const value = callback()
    return value
  },
  configurable: false,
  enumerable: false,
})
```

## Singleton getters
Singleton getters are also defined on the class prototype. However, their values are cached after the first access.

```ts
const singleton = true

Mysql.getter('version', function () {
  return this.config.driver.split('-')[1]
}, singleton)
```

Adding a singleton getter is same as writing the following code in JavaScript.

```ts
Object.defineProperty(Mysql.prototype, 'version', {
  get() {
    const value = callback()

    // Cache value on the class instance
    Object.defineProperty(this, 'version', {
      configurable: false,
      enumerable: false,
      value: value,
      writable: false,
    })

    return value
  },
  configurable: false,
  enumerable: false,
})
```

## TypeScript types
You will have to use [module augmentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation) in order to define the types for the dynamically added properties.
